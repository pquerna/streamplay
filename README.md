# Streamplay

It is modular tool to make log shipping and log processing a lot better.  It
borrows some ideas and terms from flume and scribe.

## Goals

* Aims to be less complex than flume for the developer
* More oriented at building modules internally to data process
* More primitives and tunables to allow certain levels of reliability and
  guarantees.
* Built for failure leveraging election protocols for HA and BCP.
